Project Requirements

* Implement a Rails application, which allows the user to view their Instagram pictures.
  * Users should authenticate with Instagram.
  * Once an account has authenticated with Instagram, the front-end should display a feed of the users pictures.
    * An error should be displayed if the user is not authenticated with Instagram.
  *  All interaction with Instagram should be done through their API, using gems where required.
* Styling   
  * Use Bootstrap or an alternative framework to implement the front end design.
  * The front end should be responsive and well designed (use the chosen CSS framework to help with this)
* Testing (Bonus Points) (Optional)
  * API
    * Use RSpec to fully test any API endpoints.
    * Ensure all actions are tested, as well as any third party services/gems they call.
    * Use mocks/stubs/doubles where appropriate..
* Deployment
  * The final application should be deployed to Heroku.
